                    Many ticket sellers make their tickets available to you before they have even been printed, which gives customers an edge on getting great seats in advance. Because this sometimes happens, tickets may not be “in hand” at the time of purchase.

Seller notes often indicate when an order will ship (at the latest), so customers know when to expect their tickets. They may also note that tickets are “in hand,” which means they can ship immediately. After your tickets have shipped, you will receive a FedEx tracking number, so you may track your purchase.

Either way, we guarantee your tickets will arrive in time.

                    Due to the nature of our exchange, there is usually some lag time between when tickets are purchased and when the ticket listings are updated. As tickets are sold, sellers must manually update their listings. This means that your tickets may have been ordered by another customer before you had the chance to submit yours.

This is a rare occurrence, but if it should happen to you, please contact us at 888-456-8499 and our customer service representatives would be happy to help you find a similar seat or a seat at a similar price.

                    Tickets are guaranteed to be together, unless the seller’s notes say otherwise. If tickets are listed in a general category, zone, section, or row, we guarantee that they will be together. Examples of these sorts of notes are: “Zone A,” “Section 200,” “Row 102,” etc.

However, sometimes the notes say something like “Section 2, rows A-Z” or “Section 2, Rows A and B, piggybacked” which lets you know that the seats may not be together. If they are “piggybacked,” it means one seat is in front of the other, but in 2 separate rows.

                    Sellers prefer to list tickets at least in pairs so as to increase the chance that they’ll be able to sell all the tickets in a listing. Entertainment events are social occasions that people usually attend with friends or family. Single tickets are very hard to sell and so sellers try to avoid being stuck with them by buying and selling tickets in larger quantities.

                    Ticket sellers don’t list seat numbers to prevent double-booking tickets. Because transactions on TN.com take place in real time, it is possible for a set of tickets to be purchased at the exact same time by two different individuals. In order to prevent this confusion, ticket sellers instead list general rows and sections. They often have several groups of tickets, so if multiple orders come in, they can successfully fill them (without anyone getting upset or disappointed).
